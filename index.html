        <h1>Explore the Future of Biking in Madison!</h1>

        <div id="intro-paragraph">
            This interactive map allows you to visualize how select bike 
            infrastructure projects in Madison, WI plan to change current 
            road layouts, paths, and more. Using engineering drawings produced 
            by the City of Madison and contractors, this map aims to simplify 
            the process of understanding infrastructure projects without spending 
            too much time attempting to understand complex engineering drawings.
 
            <br><br>You can use the project map to see exactly where new bike 
            projects will be. Select one of 12 different points of interest on 
            the map to retrieve the details of a site â€” it will provide you 
            with an image of the new site, the construction timeline, and links 
            to the City of Madison project page. The comparison map shows you 
            an overview where current and future bike paths and trails are 
            located. Use the slider bar to see the before and after and use 
            the dropdown to select different path designations by the City.
